Somewhat familiar with basic html, so didn't have a hard time with that part. VSC helps a lot with keeping code neat.  Felt myself getting sloppy when I'd used codepen in the past.

Feel good about being able to practice file structure in projects.  Always learn more when I practice with new information.

Also enjoyed using git to add files to the staging area and committing them.  Felt like a small victory and dopamine rush every time a file was ready to commit.  Still doesnt feel like I know exactly what I'm doing with git though.  I did a lot of "lets just see what happens when i do this."
